# Material Receipt Module - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a complete Material Receipt management system integrated with the Purchase module, enabling tracking of material deliveries with vehicle weighing and bidirectional linking to purchase bills.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Data Layer

**Files Created/Modified:**

**Key Features:**

- MaterialReceipt type with fields: date, vehicleNumber, materialId, materialName, filledWeight, emptyWeight, netWeight, linkedPurchaseId
- Context provider with CRUD operations and linking methods
- Mock data with 3 sample receipts (1 linked, 2 open)
- One-to-one linking enforcement between receipts and purchases

### 2. Material Receipt Form

**File:** `src/components/forms/MaterialReceiptForm.tsx`

**Features:**

- React Hook Form + Zod validation
- Fields:
  - Date picker for receipt date
  - Vehicle number input with format validation (KA-01-AB-1234)
  - Material dropdown from active material master
  - Filled weight and empty weight inputs (kg)
  - **Auto-calculated net weight** display (filled - empty)
- Real-time weight calculation as user types
- Edit mode support
- Toast notifications for success/error
- Full accessibility support

### 3. Material Receipt Page

**File:** `src/components/purchase-receipt.tsx`

**Features:**

- **Statistics Dashboard:**
  - Total Receipts count
  - Total Net Weight (kg)
  - Linked receipts count
  - Open receipts count
- **Search & Filters:**
  - Search by vehicle number or material name

  - Weights breakdown (Filled/Empty/Net)
  - **Link Status** badge (Green "Linked to [Invoice]" or Gray "Open")
  - Actions (Edit, Delete, Link/Unlink)
- **Linking Dialog:**
  - Select purchase bill from dropdown
  - Shows only available purchases (without receipt)
  - Confirms linking with toast notification

### 4. Purchase Module Updates

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/shared/PurchaseForm.tsx`
- `src/components/purchase.tsx`

**Features Added:**

- **PurchaseForm:**
  - Optional "Link Material Receipt" dropdown field
  - Shows only unlinked receipts
  - Auto-links receipt on purchase submission
- **Purchase Page:**
  - Displays linked receipt information (future enhancement)
  - Supports creating purchases with receipt linking

### 5. Navigation Integration

**Files:**

- `src/components/layout/PurchaseTabs.tsx` (new)
- `src/app/purchase/receipt/page.tsx` (new route)

**Features:**

- Tab navigation between "Purchase Bills" and "Material Receipts"
- Active tab highlighting
- Accessible navigation with ARIA labels
- Integrated into both purchase and receipt pages

### 6. Provider Integration

**File Modified:** `src/components/AppShell.tsx`

- Added `MaterialReceiptsProvider` to app-wide context
- Wraps MaterialsProvider for proper data access

## Workflow Demonstration

### Recording a Material Receipt

1. Navigate to `/purchase/receipt`
2. Click "Add Receipt"
3. Enter:
   - Date: 2024-10-17
   - Vehicle: KA-01-AB-1234
   - Material: Select from dropdown (e.g., OPC Cement)
   - Filled Weight: 5500 kg
   - Empty Weight: 50 kg
   - Net Weight: **5450 kg** (auto-calculated)
4. Submit â†’ Receipt saved and shown in table with "Open" status

### Linking Receipt to Purchase (Method 1: From Receipt)

1. In Material Receipts table, find an open receipt
2. Click the Link icon (ðŸ”—)
3. Select a purchase bill from dropdown
4. Confirm â†’ Status changes to "Linked to [Invoice#]"

### Linking Receipt to Purchase (Method 2: From Purchase Form)

1. Navigate to `/purchase`
2. Click "Add Purchase"
3. Fill in purchase details
4. In "Link Material Receipt" dropdown, select an open receipt
5. Submit â†’ Purchase created and automatically linked to receipt

### Unlinking a Receipt

1. In Material Receipts table, find a linked receipt
2. Click the Unlink icon
3. Confirm â†’ Status changes back to "Open"

## Technical Highlights

### Auto-Calculation

- Net weight calculates in real-time: `netWeight = filledWeight - emptyWeight`
- Displayed prominently in form and table
- Validation ensures positive values

### One-to-One Enforcement

- Receipts dropdown filters out already-linked receipts
- Purchase dropdown filters out purchases with receipts
- Context methods validate before linking
- Error toasts prevent invalid linking

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)

- Proper ARIA labels on all form fields
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management in dialogs
- Screen reader friendly badges and icons
- Skip links and semantic HTML

### Best Practices

- TypeScript strict typing throughout
- Zod schema validation
- Shared hooks (useDialogState, useTableState)
- Component composition (DataTable, FormDialog)
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- No inline hex colors (uses Tailwind tokens)

## Files Created

1. `/src/components/shared/materialReceiptsContext.tsx`
2. `/src/components/forms/MaterialReceiptForm.tsx`

4. `/src/components/layout/PurchaseTabs.tsx`
5. `/src/app/purchase/receipt/page.tsx`
6. `/MATERIAL_RECEIPT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (this file)

## Files Modified

1. `/src/types.ts` - Added MaterialReceipt interface
2. `/src/components/shared/materialsContext.tsx` - Added linkedReceiptId field

- Vehicle number format validated as Indian standard (KA-01-AB-1234)
- All weights stored in kilograms (kg)
- Follows project's coding standards and architecture patterns
