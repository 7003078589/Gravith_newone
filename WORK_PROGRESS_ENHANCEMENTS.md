# Work Progress Component Enhancements

## Overview

The Work Progress component (`src/components/work-progress.tsx`) has been enhanced with comprehensive data capture capabilities for construction work tracking.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Enhanced Data Capture

The component now collects detailed work information:

#### **Basic Information**

- **Work Type**: Foundation, Plumbing, Electrical, Painting, Roofing, Flooring, Masonry, Plastering
- **Date**: Date picker for work completion
- **Site Selection**: Site-specific work entries with dropdown selection
- **Description**: Detailed description of work performed

#### **Measurements**

- **Unit Selection**:
  - Cubic Meter (cum)
  - Square Meter (sqm)
  - Running Meter (rmt)
  - Numbers (nos)
  - Square Feet (sqft)
  - Cubic Feet (cft)
- **Dimensions**:
  - Length (in meters)
  - Breadth (in meters)
  - Thickness (in meters)
- **Total Quantity**: Auto-calculated or manual entry

### 2. Material Consumption Tracking

#### **Features**

- **Site-Specific Material Selection**: Only shows materials available at the selected site
- **Real-Time Balance Stock Display**: Shows remaining quantity for each material
- **Multiple Material Addition**: Add multiple materials to a single work entry
- **Quantity Validation**: Prevents over-consumption beyond available stock
- **Material Consumption Preview**: Displays balance after consumption before submission

#### **Material Entry Cards**

Each added material displays:

- Material name
- Quantity used and unit
- Balance stock after consumption
- Remove option

#### **Stock Management**

- Automatically deducts consumed materials from inventory
- Updates `consumedQuantity` and `remainingQuantity` in materials context
- Prevents negative stock with validation

### 3. Site Linking & Selection

#### **Implementation**

- **Site Selection Follows Date**: Site dropdown appears after date selection for logical data entry flow
- **Site-Specific Data**: All work entries are tied to a specific site
- **Material Filtering**: Materials are automatically filtered based on selected site
- **Dynamic Material Reset**: Materials list resets when site changes to prevent cross-site material usage

#### **Mock Sites**

- Rajiv Nagar Residential Complex
- Green Valley Commercial Center
- Sunshine Apartments Phase II

### 4. Photo Attachments

#### **Features**

- **Multi-Photo Upload**: Upload multiple photos at once
- **Image Preview**: Grid view of uploaded images (3 columns)
- **Photo Management**: Remove individual photos with hover action
- **Empty State**: Clear message when no photos are attached
- **Next.js Image Optimization**: Uses Next.js `Image` component for optimal performance

#### **Technical Details**

- Accepts: `image/*` format
- Uses `URL.createObjectURL()` for client-side preview (production should use cloud storage)
- 3-column responsive grid layout
- Hover-triggered delete buttons with smooth transitions

### 5. Labor & Progress Tracking

- **Labor Hours**: Track total labor hours (supports decimal values)
- **Progress Percentage**: Track completion percentage (0-100%)
- **Status Management**:
  - In Progress (blue badge)
  - Completed (green badge)
  - On Hold (yellow badge)

### 6. Additional Notes

Free-form text area for additional observations and comments about the work performed.

## Updated Data Model

### WorkProgressEntry Interface

```typescript
interface WorkProgressEntry {
  id: string;
  siteId: string;
  siteName: string;
  workType: string;
  description: string;
  date: string;
  unit: string;
  length?: number;
  breadth?: number;
  thickness?: number;
  totalQuantity: number;
  materialsUsed: {
    materialId: string;
    materialName: string;
    quantity: number;
    unit: string;
    balanceStock: number;
  }[];
  laborHours: number;
  progressPercentage: number;
  notes: string;
  photos: string[];
  status: 'In Progress' | 'Completed' | 'On Hold';
}
```

## UI/UX Improvements

### 1. Form Organization

- **Sectioned Layout**: Form divided into logical sections with headers
- **ScrollArea**: Vertical scrolling for long forms (max-height: 70vh)
- **Visual Separators**: Clear section dividers using Separator component
- **Larger Modal**: Increased to `max-w-4xl` for better content display

### 2. Form Sections

1. **Basic Information**: Work type, date, site, description
2. **Measurements**: Unit, dimensions, total quantity
3. **Material Consumption**: Material selection, quantity, balance display
4. **Labor & Progress**: Hours, percentage, status
5. **Photo Attachments**: Upload, preview, manage
6. **Additional Notes**: Free-form text

### 3. Validation & Feedback

- **Required Fields**: Work type, date, site, description, unit, total quantity
- **Stock Validation**: Alert when trying to consume more than available
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no materials or site not selected
- **Balance Display**: Real-time stock information during material selection

### 4. Responsive Design

- Form adapts to different screen sizes
- Grid layouts adjust for mobile/tablet/desktop
- Touch-friendly interaction targets
- Optimized image grid for various viewports

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Materials Context

- Reads from `useMaterials()` hook
- Updates material inventory on work entry submission
- Filters materials by site name
- Updates `consumedQuantity` and `remainingQuantity`

### Dialog State Management

- Uses `useDialogState` hook for modal management
- Handles create/edit modes
- Form reset on close/cancel

### Table State Management

- Uses `useTableState` for search, sort, pagination
- Maintains existing filtering capabilities
- Integrates with DataTable component

## Technical Implementation

### Key Functions

#### `handleAddMaterial()`

- Validates material selection and quantity
- Checks stock availability
- Adds material to form state with balance calculation
- Resets selection fields

#### `handleRemoveMaterial(index)`

- Removes material from materials list by index
- Updates form state

#### `handlePhotoUpload(e)`

- Processes multiple file uploads
- Creates object URLs for preview
- Updates photos array in form state

#### `handleRemovePhoto(index)`

### State Management

```typescript
// Form state
const [workProgressForm, setWorkProgressForm] = useState({
  siteId: '',
  siteName: '',
  workType: '',
  description: '',
  date: '',
  unit: '',
  length: 0,
  breadth: 0,
  thickness: 0,
  totalQuantity: 0,
  materialsUsed: [],
  laborHours: 0,
  progressPercentage: 0,
  notes: '',
  photos: [],
  status: 'In Progress',
});

// Material selection state
const [selectedMaterial, setSelectedMaterial] = useState('');
const [materialQuantity, setMaterialQuantity] = useState(0);
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Cloud Storage Integration**: Replace `URL.createObjectURL()` with actual cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.)
2. **Automatic Quantity Calculation**: Calculate total quantity from length × breadth × thickness based on unit type
3. **Material Categories**: Group materials by category for easier selection
4. **Barcode Scanning**: Scan material barcodes for faster entry
